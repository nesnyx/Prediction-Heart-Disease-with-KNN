<h1>Prediction Heart Disease with KNN and The combo GridSearchCV with Pipeline</h1>
<br>
<p>A simple project to predict heart disease using a dataset I found on Kaggle. I used simple tuning, KNN, Pipeline, and GridSearchCV.</p><br>
<br>
Check in the below if you want know more about these technology from Scikit-Learn
<br>
KNeighbors = https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html
<br>
Pipeline = https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html
<br>
GridSearchCV = https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html
<br>
Based on prediction, train data from that, i got my best score with the model.
First i just used Pipeline + KNN without GridSearchCV and the result is <b>0.8688524590163934</b>
and with Pipeline + KNN + GridSearchCV is <b>0.8852459016393442</b>.
<br>
<br>
Score Between from both score doest has more gap.
<br>
Thanks for reading this simple project, i hope can improve more and develop more.<br>
Thanks for advice, sharing if you are sharing to me, i appricated with that.
